        <h3>About Me:</h3>
        <p>Hello, my name is Jesse aka Unnecessary Websites and I create unnecessary websites. So to give a brief description on why I do this, well, I've always
            wanted to code but i've never been able to decide on what. That was until recently, when I was sitting and thinking and the idea hit me (not literally of course).
            I thought, why don't I just create useless and pointless websites that no one needs and why don't I also make a TikTok account to document what I make and
            to get ideas on what I should make, and now we're here! This is also helping me improve on my HTML & CSS skills as i'm not too good at either. Thank you everyone for
            the help to get to this point and I can't wait to see how far this goes. -Unnecessary Websites
